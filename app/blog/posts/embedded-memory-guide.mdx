# 🧠 How Memory Works in Embedded Systems: Stack, Heap, and Static

In embedded systems, **memory is your budget**. Unlike general-purpose applications that run on machines with gigabytes of RAM, embedded programs often live in a few kilobytes—sometimes even less. You can't afford to waste space or ignore what happens behind the scenes. You must know where every variable lives, how it behaves, and what your hardware expects.

In this post, we’ll break down how memory works in embedded systems, especially focusing on **stack**, **heap**, and **static memory**, plus how these sections map into real memory regions like RAM and Flash. We’ll also touch on key embedded-specific practices like using `volatile`, aligning DMA buffers, and checking memory safety using linker files.

## 📊 Visual Memory Layout in Embedded Systems

Here’s a simplified view of memory in a typical embedded microcontroller (like an STM32 or AVR):

```
+-------------------------+ ← Flash (Non-Volatile)
| .text (Code)           |
| .rodata (const data)   |
+-------------------------+
| .data (globals, static)|
| .bss  (zero-init vars) |
+-------------------------+ ← RAM starts here
| Heap (grows upward)    |
|   malloc()/free()      |
+-------------------------+
| Stack (grows downward) |
|   local vars, return   |
+-------------------------+
```

- **Flash** stores the program code and constant data
- **RAM** is where the stack, heap, and global/static variables live
- Stack and heap grow **toward each other**, and if they collide: your system crashes

---

## 📦 The Stack: Fast, Temporary, and Risky

The **stack** is the region used for local variables and function call metadata (like return addresses). It’s managed automatically in a **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** manner.

### ✅ Why Use the Stack:
- Very fast
- Cleared automatically on function return
- Great for small, temporary data

### ⚠️ Why Be Careful:
- **Fixed size**: set in linker/startup config
- **Easy to overflow**: deep function calls or large local arrays can eat it up

```c
void blinkLED() {
    int delay = 1000;        // stored on stack
    char buffer[32];         // OK, but large arrays? Bad idea.
}
```

💡 **Tip**: Don’t place large buffers or recursive logic in stack-heavy systems.

---

## 🧮 The Heap: Flexible but Dangerous

The **heap** is dynamically allocated memory—used via `malloc()` and `free()`. It grows upward and gives you runtime flexibility.

### ✅ Pros:
- Allows dynamic memory (buffers, queues, etc.)
- Necessary in modular or RTOS-based systems

### ⚠️ Cons:
- Manual management required
- Fragmentation risk
- Slower, and can fail silently if exhausted

```c
char *rxBuffer = malloc(128);
if (rxBuffer != NULL) {
    process(rxBuffer);
    free(rxBuffer);
}
```

💡 **Tip**: Avoid dynamic memory inside **interrupts** or **real-time loops**. Preallocate wherever possible.

---

## 🔒 Static and Global Memory: Predictable and Persistent

Static and global variables are allocated at compile time and remain in memory for the program’s entire life.

### `static` variables:
- Keep their value across function calls
- Scoped to function/file

### Global variables:
- Accessible everywhere
- Risky in large codebases (use with care!)

```c
static int counter = 0;  // retains value across calls
```

💡 **Common Use**: Static counters, state machines, and ISR-safe flags.

---

## ⚡ `volatile`: The Keyword You Must Understand

In embedded systems, `volatile` tells the compiler: **“This variable may change outside the current context—don’t optimize it away.”**

Without it, the compiler may assume nothing changed and optimize out memory reads.

```c
volatile int dataReady = 0;

void USART_IRQHandler() {
    dataReady = 1;
}

int main() {
    while (!dataReady);  // without 'volatile', compiler may optimize this loop away
    processData();
}
```

💡 **Use `volatile`** when:
- Sharing data between **main loop and ISR**
- Accessing **hardware registers**
- Polling **flags or peripherals**

---

## 📡 DMA Buffers and Memory Attributes

When using **DMA**, buffers must meet alignment requirements or reside in DMA-accessible memory regions.

```c
__attribute__((aligned(4))) uint8_t dmaBuffer[512];

__attribute__((section(".dma_buffer"))) uint8_t adcData[64];
```

💡 DMA buffers must be:
- Aligned (commonly 4 or 8 bytes)
- Located in memory accessible to the DMA controller

## 📂 Memory Locations for Each Type

| Code Pattern                          | Memory Location      | Lifetime           |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| `int x = 10;` inside function         | **Stack**            | Until function ends|
| `static int count = 0;`              | **.data (RAM)**      | Entire program     |
| `malloc(64)`                         | **Heap (RAM)**       | Until `free()`     |
| `const char *msg = "Hello";`         | **.rodata (Flash)**  | Read-only forever  |
| `volatile uint8_t status;`           | **.bss / .data**     | Entire program     |

---

## 📉 Common Embedded Memory Mistakes

- Declaring large arrays on the stack (overflow risk)
- Using dynamic memory without freeing it (memory leaks)
- Forgetting `volatile` on hardware-interfaced variables
- Recursing deeply in a memory-constrained environment
- Assuming global memory is always safe in interrupt context

---

## ✅ Tips for Safer Embedded Memory

- Prefer `const` for anything that doesn't need to change—stores in Flash
- Use `static` variables in ISRs instead of globals
- Minimize heap usage unless you’re in an RTOS-managed system
- Monitor memory usage via `.map` files (check stack/heap limits)
- Understand your **linker script**—it decides what goes where

---

## 📎 Bonus: Analyzing Memory Usage with `.map` Files

Use compiler tools to inspect memory usage:

```bash
# Check section sizes
arm-none-eabi-size my_firmware.elf

# Sort by size
arm-none-eabi-nm -S --size-sort my_firmware.elf
```

This helps you detect:
- Bloating static variables
- Unexpected large heap/stack allocations
- Inefficient placement of large `const` data

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

In embedded systems, **memory is more than storage—it's structure.** Misusing memory can crash systems, cause silent data corruption, or introduce timing bugs that are near impossible to trace.

Understanding the difference between **stack**, **heap**, and **static** memory—and how they live in the microcontroller’s address space—is not optional. It’s essential. It makes your firmware faster, more reliable, and maintainable.

Whether you’re blinking an LED, parsing UART data, or setting up DMA transfers, remember: good memory discipline is what separates “working” code from *robust* systems.
