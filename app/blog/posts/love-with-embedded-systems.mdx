# **🔌 How I Fell in Love with Embedded Systems**

It was 2016. I was in 9th standard, sitting in front of a 10-year-old HCL laptop with just 2GB RAM and a Pentium processor. But none of that mattered. What mattered was that I had just written my first web page. It was nothing more than some colored divs, a few links, and maybe a table or two. But seeing that page render inside a browser felt magical. It was my first experience of creating something with code.

This was my first window into programming. While others around me were focused on school subjects, I found joy in \<style> tags and HTML tables. I didn’t know what a microcontroller was. I didn’t know what embedded systems even meant. But I had started—and that was enough.

## **🧠 Real Programming Begins**

By 2019, during my diploma, I started exploring C. And that’s when the real fun (and frustration) began. I remember trying to write a calculator program in Turbo C, running into endless errors, and wondering why nothing ever worked the way I thought it should. But I loved it. Even the bugs.

There was something pure about writing C—minimal abstraction, full control, and brutal honesty. Either it worked, or it didn’t. And slowly, I began to understand how computers actually think. Programming was no longer just about "what you see on screen"—it was about logic, memory, and precision.

## **💡 First Hardware Project — Sequential LED Blinker (Late 2019)**

My journey with hardware began soon after. I built a sequential LED blinking circuit using a 555 timer and 4017 decade counter. It was basic, yes—but when I saw those LEDs blink in a perfect sequence, I felt something shift. For the first time, my code and logic weren't just pixels—they were physical.

This was my first true embedded moment: the moment where I stopped being a "software-only" person and started becoming someone who cared about circuits, signals, and hardware behavior. It wasn’t clean. It wasn’t easy. But it was real.

## **🚘 My First Robot — Self-Driving Car with Collision Avoidance (2020)**

In 2020, I took things up a notch and built a simple autonomous robot car with ultrasonic collision detection. I used Arduino, ultrasonic sensors, and motor drivers—all soldered and assembled on my hostel room desk.

This wasn’t just a coding challenge—it was an exercise in system design: power, movement, signal processing, and real-time reaction. Every crash (literal and metaphorical) taught me something new. I loved how embedded systems demanded both coding logic and practical engineering. It was no longer just about writing good code—it was about making everything work together.

# **📡 Final Year Project — Real-Time Vehicle Tracking (2021)**

By the time I reached my final year of diploma in 2021, I was ready for something bigger. I built a real-time vehicle tracking system using the SIM900A GSM module, a GPS receiver, and a microcontroller. The idea: track a vehicle’s location in real-time and send it via SMS or GPRS to a remote server.

This project was long, intense, and incredibly rewarding. I learned how to interface with AT commands, how to parse NMEA GPS data, and how to debug serial communication issues with limited tools. I understood the critical importance of power supply stability, baud rate synchronization, and antenna positioning. Every component mattered. Every line of C code could crash the system—or make it work.

I have dozens of photos from that project—snapshots of breadboards, messy jumper wires, test logs, and successful data transmissions. Those photos are memories. They remind me that this is where my love for embedded systems became something deeper: commitment.

## **🌐 From Projects to Profession — *Silicon Labs Internship (2025)***

As I moved on to B.Tech (2021–2024) and now my M.Tech at IIT Jammu (2024–2026), I kept building. I explored encryption, networking, wireless protocols, and system-level programming. And then came the moment that validated it all—I landed an internship at Silicon Labs.

Silicon Labs is one of the global leaders in embedded Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and IoT SDKs. I had spent time reading about their work and was genuinely fascinated by the kind of wireless systems they built. When I got the offer to join them as a Wi-Fi Embedded Programmer, it felt like the pieces of my journey had come together—from blinking LEDs to building full wireless systems.

# **❤️ Why Embedded Still Feels Like Magic**

Even now, I find embedded systems endlessly fascinating. It’s a world where every bug is a puzzle, every crash has a cause, and every success feels earned. You deal with real hardware. You write low-level code that talks directly to silicon. You flash firmware and watch the world respond.

It’s not glamorous—but it’s real. It’s not always elegant—but it’s powerful. Embedded systems have taught me how to think, how to be precise, how to handle failure, and how to persist. And I know this is just the beginning.
