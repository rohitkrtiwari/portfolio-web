# The Curse of Competetive Exams

Competitive exams, It all started with that.
That was the first time I really pushed myself. I worked harder than I ever had. I surprised myself every day. I saw how much we are truly capable of when we give it everything. My focus was sharp, like Arjun’s. I felt powerful, unstoppable. And I made it. I achieved what I set out to do. I believed nothing could stop me now — and honestly, I still believe that about myself.

But something changed.

I didn’t stop being capable. I didn’t stop working. But slowly, I started feeling tired. Not physically, but mentally. I felt heavy — like something inside was just… drained. And I kept wondering:
How long can someone keep going at their maximum potential?
Will there come a point where you want to continue, but just can’t anymore?
What are we supposed to do then?
What do we say to the people who expect us to always be at our best?

I thought a lot about this. And I realised something, something important.

It was not the hard work that made me tired.
It was the pressure — the pressure to always shine, always win, always succeed.
When your focus is only on results, life becomes a burden. Even doing things you once loved starts to feel heavy.

And that’s not how we’re meant to live.

We can’t carry the weight of expectations forever. At some point, we have to stop and ask ourselves: Do I still enjoy this? Am I doing this for me, or just to meet someone else’s idea of success?

I remember as a young boy, there was a lot curiosity for so many things. and there will be so many things that i would want to do. It is always good to keep that inner child alive. Feel what silly or curious thing that inner child is desiring right now and fulfil that. Hear what it had to say, it's your responsibility to hear and take care of that inner child. Because that is what will keep you alive.

We don’t always need flying colours.
Sometimes, a calm mind and a happy heart is more than enough.
