# The Curse of Competetive Exams

Competitive exams, That was the first time I really pushed myself. I worked harder than I ever had. I surprised myself every day. I saw how much we are truly capable of when we give it everything. My focus was sharp, like Arjun's. I felt powerful, unstoppable. And I made it. I achieved what I set out to do.


But something changed.

I didn't stop being capable. I didn't stop working. But slowly, I started feeling tired. Not physically, but mentally. I felt heavy — like something inside was just… drained. I would sit with my books and just stare. My mind felt foggy. Even things I loved started feeling like work.

And I kept wondering: How long can someone keep going at their maximum potential? Will there come a point where you want to continue, but just can't anymore? What are we supposed to do then? What do we say to the people who expect us to always be at our best?

I thought a lot about this. And I realised something, something important.

It was not the hard work that made me tired. It was the pressure — the pressure to always shine, always win, always succeed. When your focus is only on results, life becomes a burden. Even doing things you once loved starts to feel heavy.

And that's not how we're meant to live.

We can't carry the weight of expectations forever. At some point, we have to stop and ask ourselves: Do I still enjoy this? Am I doing this for me, or just to meet someone else's idea of success?

What I realized? Sometimes we get so caught up in proving ourselves that we forget who we actually are underneath all of that.

I remember as a young boy, there was a lot curiosity for so many things. and there will be so many things that I would want to do. Not because they looked good on paper or would impress anyone. Just because they were interesting. Just because they made me curious.

It is always good to keep that inner child alive. Feel what silly or curious thing that inner child is desiring right now and fulfill that. Hear what it had to say, it's your responsibility to hear and take care of that inner child. Because that is what will keep you alive. That curiosity, that wonder, that joy in small things.

When did you last do something just because it made you happy? Not because it was productive or would help your career or looked good to others. Just because it brought you joy?

That child inside you remembers what it felt like to learn something new just for the magic of it.

We don't always need flying colours. Sometimes, a calm mind and a happy heart is more than enough.

Let me tell you what this looks like for me now. When I feel that pressure building up again — and trust me, it still happens - sometimes I ask myself: Am I enjoying this?

I've think I should started doing things that serve no purpose except making me smile. Reading random articles about things, Or just Taking long peaceful walks with yourselfs.

I check in with my inner child. What does it want to explore today? What would make it laugh? Is it reading about something ? What would make its eyes light up?

If you're reading this and you also feel that familiar weight of always needing to be perfect, to always perform, to always prove yourself — I want you to know that sometimes removing that burden of your head actually improves your performance. So try that way.

Sometimes the most radical thing we can do is simply be kind to ourselves.
